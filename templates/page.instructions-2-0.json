        "text": "<p>Greeting, and congratulations on your purchase of Re-Nuble’s<br\/>ReNu Terra microgreen mats! You’ve made a great decision to use one of the most<br\/>interesting products in the space that prioritizes sustainability, performance,<br\/>and cost. We’ve provided this guide specifically for users that don’t have<br\/>access to a hydroponic system or automated irrigation system, or that prefer<br\/>growing microgreens manually.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Here’s what you’ll need to get started:<\/p><p>-A standard 1020 tray with a solid bottom (no holes)<\/p><p>-A standard 1020 insret with a mesh bottom (or holes) that<br\/>fits your solid bottom tray snuggly<\/p><p>-A lid or dome that can cover your tray and insert without<br\/>leaving large gaps open<\/p><p>-A spray bottle<\/p><p>-Your choice of seeds<\/p><p> <\/p><p>1. Preparing your materials:<\/p><p>-Take one ReNu Terra mat out of the packaging and lay it<br\/>flat on your 1020 insert.<\/p><p>-Separately, place your 1020 tray where you plan to grow the<br\/>microgreens and pour 8.5 cups (2L) of water into it.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>2. Wetting the mat:<\/p><p>-The best way to wet the mat is to spray it with your sink<br\/>or shower head while it lays flat in the 1020 insert until it looks fully<br\/>saturated.<\/p><p>-Keep it horizontal while moving it to the 1020 tray with<br\/>water to avoid losing any of the water that the mat has absorbed.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>3. Seeding:<\/p><p>-After wetting it, place the mat in the 1020 insert into the<br\/>1020 tray where you poured in the water.<\/p><p>-Measure out the seeds you wish to sow (quantity recommended<br\/>by seed vendor) and sprinkle them evenly over the wet mat.<\/p><p>-Spray the sown seeds with water.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>4. Germination:<\/p><p>-Cover the stacked tray, and seeded mat with the lid or dome<br\/>and keep it covered for 2 days.<\/p><p>-After 2 days, check to see if your seeds are filly<br\/>germinated, and remove the lid if they are.<\/p><p>-You can move the tray around when it’s covered, just be<br\/>sure to keep it horizontal at all times.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>5. Irrigation:<\/p><p>-Check the bottom 1020 tray daily and keep it topped off<br\/>with water to a depth of about half an inch, or about half a fingertip deep.<\/p><p>-If you want to grow your microgreens longer than one week<br\/>after germination, they will need fertilizer.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>6. Harvesting:<\/p><p>-The best thing to do when you’re ready to harvest is to<br\/>harvest all the microgreens at once.<\/p><p>-Use a knife or scissors to carefully cut the microgreens at<br\/>the stem just above the mat.<\/p><p>-Lay them out in the empty 1020 tray with paper towels laid<br\/>down and tamp them dry before putting them in a bag or container in the fridge,<br\/>then consume within one week.<\/p><p>-Discard the used mat and roots in your compost, and wash<br\/>the tray, insert, and lid with soap and water before reusing them.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Feel free to experiment and have fun, and let us know what<br\/>ends up working best for you in your situation. Thanks for joining us on our<br\/>mission of sustainable and healthy living, and happy growing!<\/p>",
